SongPickerANE
=============

A song picker/player AIR native extension for iOS and Android.

Author: Rich Lovejoy (https://github.com/richpixel)

The SongPicker Air Native Extension lets you choose a song from your music library on your iOS or Android device 
using the native media picker, and play it back using the native media player.

#Notes:#
- You must include the following lines in the Android manifest section of your app config xml file to use the picker:

  ...
	
<application>
<activity android:name="com.newpixel.songpicker.PickSongActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"></activity>
</application>

- You must specify the iOS SDK to build against when packaging an app for iOS. (ActionScript Build Packaging > Apple iOS > Native Extensions)
